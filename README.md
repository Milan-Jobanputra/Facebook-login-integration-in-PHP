Facebook login integration in PHP

Create a Facebook App:
Go to the Facebook Developer portal (https://developers.facebook.com/).
Create a new app if you haven’t already. This will provide you with an App ID and App Secret.

Download and Include the Facebook PHP SDK:
You can download the Facebook PHP SDK from GitHub (https://github.com/facebook/php-graph-sdk).
Extract the SDK and include it in your PHP project.


Set Up Your PHP File:
Create a PHP file for handling the Facebook login, e.g., login.php.

Create a Callback Page:
Create another PHP file, e.g., fb-callback.php, to handle the callback after the user logs in.

Handle the Callback:
In the fb-callback.php file, you’ll need to handle the callback and get the user’s information.

Logout Option:
Provide a way for users to log out of their Facebook session and your application.

Security and Best Practices:
Ensure you follow best practices for security, such as using HTTPS on your website.

Protect your App Secret; don’t expose it in your client-side code.
Implement error handling and user feedback to deal with potential issues during the login process.
